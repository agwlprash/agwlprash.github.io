### Background

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering at Northumbria University. I obtained a Distinction in my Bachelors in Engineering (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India (2006-2010). After a year of industrial training, I was selected as a PhD candidate in the IITB-Monash Research Academy, a collaboration between Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India and Monash University, Australia (2011-2016). I worked at the Iowa State University, USA for one year as a post-doctoral researcher (2016).  Prior to joining as a Lecturer, I worked as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Northumbria University (2017-2020), in an EPSRC project in collaboration with a team at the University of Edinburgh.

### Interests

My research interest is in multiphase fluid dynamics (discrete and transient) which involves developing tools and techniques for different engineering applications. Several natural and industrial processes rely on multiphase flows, e.g., nutrient transport in biological systems, sediment transport in water bodies, microparticle production, drug delivery and heat exchangers. Their ubiquitous nature at a wide range of system scales, from microchannel flows to industrial scale reactors, have spawned applications across several industries and disciplines such as energy harvesting (Applied Energy 2019), forensics (Forensic Science International 2016, 2017) and the development of healthcare and diagnostic devices (Physical Review Applied 2018, 2019). Further advancements in these fields necessitate an interdisciplinary research for understanding the complex interaction between multiple phases and, subsequently, to develop novel and robust technologies for applications in the respective disciplines.

Over the course of my research career I have worked on different fundamental and applied problems: from investigating microparticle dynamics in vibrating droplets to developing novel frictionless engines. To achieve these research objectives, I design and develop experimental procedures and formulate supportive analytical and numerical models. I intend to pursue research primarily focused on fluid flow interactions with particulate matter and porous media, with primary application focus towards device design for healthcare and diagnostic applications.
