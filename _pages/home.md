## Nature Inspired Transport Systems

### Research

My research interests are in multiphase fluid dynamics and involves developing tools and techniques for different engineering applications. Several natural and industrial processes rely on multiphase flows, e.g., nutrient transport in biological systems, sediment transport in water bodies, microparticle production, drug delivery and heat exchangers. Their ubiquitous nature at a wide range of system scales, from microchannel flows to industrial scale reactors, have spawned applications across several industries and disciplines such as energy harvesting, forensics and the development of healthcare and diagnostic devices.

Over the course of my research career I have worked on different fundamental and applied problems: from investigating microparticle dynamics in vibrating droplets to developing novel frictionless engines. To achieve these research objectives, I design and develop experimental procedures and formulate supportive analytical and numerical models.
