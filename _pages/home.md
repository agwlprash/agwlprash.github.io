### Background

I am a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering at Northumbria University. I obtained a Distinction in my Bachelors in Engineering (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani, India (2006-2010). After a year of industrial training, I was selected as a PhD candidate in the IITB-Monash Research Academy, a collaboration between Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, India and Monash University, Australia (2011-2016). I worked at the Iowa State University, USA for one year as a post-doctoral researcher (2016).  Prior to joining as a Lecturer, I worked as a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at Northumbria University (2017-2020), on an EPSRC project.

### Research interests

My research interests are in multiphase fluid dynamics and involves developing tools and techniques for different engineering applications. Several natural and industrial processes rely on multiphase flows, e.g., nutrient transport in biological systems, sediment transport in water bodies, microparticle production, drug delivery and heat exchangers. Their ubiquitous nature at a wide range of system scales, from microchannel flows to industrial scale reactors, have spawned applications across several industries and disciplines such as energy harvesting, forensics and the development of healthcare and diagnostic devices.

Over the course of my research career I have worked on different fundamental and applied problems: from investigating microparticle dynamics in vibrating droplets to developing novel frictionless engines. To achieve these research objectives, I design and develop experimental procedures and formulate supportive analytical and numerical models.
