The project will aim to develop novel scalable technologies for micro/nano-particle (solids, capsules, cells, emulsions) enrichment and sorting. This translational project follows our work on Particle Dynamics: [Research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/Research/){: .btn .btn--inverse}

The project is a continuation of our previously funded Northern Accelerator feasibility study. [Christopher Markwell] starts on this project for the next 10 months. The other project partners are [Dr Hamdi Torun](https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/persons/hamdi-torun "HT") and [Micropore Technolgies](https://microporetech.com/ "MT").
